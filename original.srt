00:00:00,52 --> 00:00:02,97
hi and welcome to Tutorial 

2
00:00:03,14 --> 00:00:03,98
I'm leveling it 

3
00:00:04,64 --> 00:00:07,16
We have lots to cover in this course what kinds 

4
00:00:07,16 --> 00:00:08,11
of things we're gonna look at 

5
00:00:08,35 --> 00:00:12,17
Well we're going to review the The core components and 

6
00:00:12,17 --> 00:00:14,61
take a look at new aspects of working with Hadoop 

7
00:00:14,61 --> 00:00:15,63
such as a data lake 

8
00:00:15,78 --> 00:00:19,09
We're going to set up a dupe development environment that's 

9
00:00:19,09 --> 00:00:21,82
going to include the use of modern library's such a 

10
00:00:21,82 --> 00:00:22,39
spark 

11
00:00:22,76 --> 00:00:25,73
Speaking of spark we're going to go pretty deep looking 

12
00:00:25,73 --> 00:00:29,27
at how spark runs and we're gonna look at spark 

13
00:00:29,27 --> 00:00:29,88
libraries 

14
00:00:29,89 --> 00:00:33,31
Such a CZ sparks equal spark our and spark ML 

15
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:00:33,31


16
00:00:33,65 --> 00:00:36,25
Now in addition to Spark we're going to discuss some 

17
00:00:36,25 --> 00:00:38,67
of the other libraries that are commonly found in Hadoop 

18
00:00:38,67 --> 00:00:39,39
pipelines 

19
00:00:39,78 --> 00:00:43,76
Apache Kafka and other Cloud Service is for streaming in 

20
00:00:43,76 --> 00:00:44,25
jest 

21
00:00:44,74 --> 00:00:47,1
We're gonna pull it all together and look at use 

22
00:00:47,1 --> 00:00:50,69
cases and modern Hadoop pipelines and architectures 

23
00:00:50,99 --> 00:00:52,95
We have a lot to learn so let's get started
